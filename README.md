Hello open source explorer, we have created this repository to help you start building your personal website using modern open source technologies that our organization recommends. 

These technologies are:

- [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) because the framework provides one of the easiest development experience for performant VueJS web applications
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because there is a strong ecosystem forming around utility-first CSS

## Resources

Since our template uses the NuxtJS framework, you will find it useful to know [why one would want to use Nuxt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITypVi-qRY)

And since the Nuxt framework is built upon the vVueiew framework, you will also find it useful to know [why one would want to use Vue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iLqZnZPdo)

If you are familiar with CSS, you may be asking why we are using tailwind. This is a valid question, and the answer I found was within [this compelling talk by Sarah Dayan about the utility-first CSS approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R50q4NES6Iw)


## Developing your personal website

**Installing dependencies.**

_If you are on a Gitpod, this step will automatically be done for you_

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install
```

**Starting a development server with a live preview**

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
```

**Generating the static build off your website to deploy on a server**

```bash
# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
