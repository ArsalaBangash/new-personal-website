          I discovered my passion for teaching and building open-source
          technology during my Computer Science undergraduate degree at UofT's
          Mississauga campus. There, I served as a Teaching Assistant and
          coordinator of a department initiative called the Hacklab which helped
          students bring their tech ideas to life.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In the industry, I have worked as a software engineer at Google and
          Vida. I loved working with teams to bring a common vision to the
          people. I was grateful for the opportunities for growth in design and
          product research & development that were made available to me there.

          Currently, I am the founder and president of Grey Software, a
          not-for-profit organization that empowers students to build
          open-source software for their communities and societies.
